# longform_one_liners.py

Maximum density. Minimal lines. No dependencies.

This file contains ten visual renderers designed as compressed, logic-dense one-liners. Each effect is a terminal hallucination crafted through layered trigonometry, recursive field modulation, and abuse of print buffers.

These are not animations. These are physics experiments written in ASCII.

## What's Inside

Each function is an atomic render unit. One line, full pressure. Each one exploits `time.time()` as a live entropy source to evolve patterns in-place.

### Function-by-Function Logic Breakdown

#### 1. Plasma Bloom Vortex

Math structure:

sin(x² + y² + t) + cos(ax + by + ct)

What it does:

Generates a radial field warped by sine/cosine phase shifts. The result is a pulsing plasma vortex with a sinusoidal envelope that rotates under temporal influence.

2. Sine Storm

Math structure:

sin(x + t + y²)

What it does:

Creates diagonal compression bands using a horizontally shifted sine wave modulated by vertical density. Output appears as a traveling fog bank under gravity strain.

3. Reactor Burst

Math structure:

sin(hypot(x, y) + t)

What it does:

Simulates a radial energy burst using Euclidean distance from origin (hypot) modulated by time. Oscillates like a particle detonation, radiating impact ripples from center.

4. Waveform Glitch

Math structure:

sum(sin((xy + t) + c) for c in range(3))

What it does:

Generates stacked sinewaves with phase offsets, compounding into logical interference patterns. Emulates channel bleed and unstable signal harmonics.

5. Symmetry Bloom

Math structure:

if (x² + y²) % N == 0

What it does:

Uses radial modulo to calculate symmetry blooms. Projects radial lattice points as circular flare patterns — pure boolean geometry using quadratic radius bounds.

6. Chromatic Cascade Bleed

Math structure:

sin(sqrt(x² + y²) * a - t)

What it does:

A concentric wavefront emitter. Uses Euclidean distance as a polar coordinate, multiplies by a scalar, and time-shifts to propagate ripple rings with chromatic gradient illusion.

7. Binary Warp Gate

Math structure:

sin(ax) + sin(by + t)

What it does:

A basic orthogonal wave merger. Two traveling waves intersect at 90° to create a binary interference banding pattern. Perceived as horizontal field pulses intersecting with vertical gates.

8. Particle Shell Echo

Math structure:

(sin(ax + t)² + cos(by - ct)²) * d

What it does:

A synthetic shell model using orthogonal sine/cosine energy orbitals. Squared terms trap oscillation in elliptical paths. Echo-like behavior emerges from phase drift.

9. Sinefold Collapse Matrix

Math structure:

abs(sin(x² + y² - t))

What it does:

Quadratic radial distortion under time-based phase shifts. Grid cells collapse and expand inward like spacetime folds. Creates localized gravity lensing patterns in ASCII.

10. Electromagnetic Bloomwave

Math structure:

sin((x² + y²)*k - t)
What it does:

Spiral-pulse explosion using radial energy wells. By treating (x² + y²) as scalar energy and modulating it over time, it simulates electromagnetic propagation across a 2D field.

Usage:

python longform_one_liners.py
Runs all ten functions in sequence with slight delay between each to simulate a logic pulse chain.
